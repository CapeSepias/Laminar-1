Laminar & Airstream are now published directly for Scala 3. This required an internal refactoring of Airstream to satisfy Scala 3's stricter variance checks.

No breaking changes unless you extended / subclassed Airstream observable types.

## Laminar Changes

* Build: Laminar and Airstream are now published directly for Scala 3.0.0-RC3 and RC2. The codebase is shared between Scala 2 and Scala 3.

* New: `EventSource`, `SignalSource`, `Source`, and `Sink` type aliases are now available in when importing `com.raquo.laminar.api.L._`



## Airstream Changes

* API: Refactor the class hierarchy to support stricter variance checks in Scala 3 (thanks, [@yurique](https://github.com/yurique)!)

  * **Migration:** If you manually extend Airstream traits `EventStream`, `Signal`, or `Observable`, you should now extend `WritableEventStream`, `WritableSignal`, and `WritableObservable` instead.

  * Other than that, everything should work as before.

* API: Allow third party packages to extend Observable types

  * **Migration:** We changed access modifiers on some members. If you are already extending Airstream observables, read the [new docs section](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream#extending-observables).
