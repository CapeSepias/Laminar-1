## New Laminar Features



### Improved Performance

I’ve adjusted some internal collection type decisions, and started using my new library **[ew](https://github.com/raquo/ew)** to get consistently fast implementations of methods like `indexOf` and `forEach` on JS types. This brings several orders of magnitude big performance improvements when rendering very large lists of children (thousands or tens of thousands of items). Most of this was actually fixed in 0.14.2, but I didn't have time to write a blog post just for that.

If you're interested in this problem as a Scala.js library author, check out **ew**'s README and see [this bug](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar/issues/108) as a practical example.



### `flatMap` and `compose` for DOM events 

Typically you subscribe to DOM events without explicitly creating any streams. This is simple and convenient, but it lacks the full palette of observables operators. And we had two ways to solve this in Laminar:

```scala
div(
  onClick.delay(1) --> observer, // does not compile
  inContext(_.events(onClick).delay(1) --> observer),
  composeEvents(onClick)(_.delay(1)) --> observer
)
```

This `composeEvents` method always rubbed me the wrong way because it's not discoverable – you can't find it via autocomplete after typing `onClick.`. Something prevented me from doing this earlier, but now I've realized that I can offer equivalent functionality as an `onClick.compose` method which works just like the observables' native `compose` method:

```scala
div(
  onClick.compose(_.delay(1)) --> observer,
  onClick
    .preventDefault
    .map(getFoo)
    .compose(_.filter(isGoodFoo).startWith(initialFoo)) --> observer,
)
```

I've also added a new `flatMap` method which is useful when you want to create a new observable on every DOM event. For example:

```scala
def makeAjaxRequest(): EventStream[Response] = ???
input(
  onInput
    .mapToValue
    .flatMap(txt => sendAjaxRequest(txt)) --> observer
)
```

If you use this new `flatMap` method in IntelliJ IDEA, you'll be annoyed to find that it causes the IDE to incorrectly report a fake type error. Not holding my breath for this being fixed, so I had to bastardize the API by adding more specialized `flatMapStream` and `flatMapSignal` methods which don't trigger the fake error in the IDE.

Between `flatMap` and `compose` it's very easy to get any stream or signal based functionality from DOM events, so there is no need to create redundant methods in `EventProcessor` (the type of `onClick` value). Because the new methods are so much more natural, `composeEvents` is now deprecated. **Migration** is trivial: `composeEvents(a)(b)` is now `a.compose(b)`.



### Easier Integration With Third Party DOM Elements

Previously you could only use low level methods to inject foreign elements into the Laminar element tree. Now if some JS library gives you a DOM element, you can wrap it in Laminar goodness and use it like any other Laminar element, including adding event listeners and dynamically updating its properties:

```scala
def getThirdPartyMapWidget(): dom.html.Element = ???
div(
  foreignHtmlElement(getThirdPartyMapWidget()),
  // And this is how you add modifiers in the same breath:
  foreignHtmlElement(getThirdPartyMapWidget()).amend(
    onMountCallback {
      thirdPartyLibraryInitMap()
    },
    onClick --> someObserver,
    onResize --> someOtherObserver
  ),
)
```

A similar `foreignSvgElement` helper is available for SVGs.

I've also added `unsafeParseSvgString(dangerousSvgString: String): dom.svg.Element` to help render SVG strings. It requires two steps, but that inconvenience is by design for such an unsafe API:

```scala
div(
  foreignSvgElement(DomApi.unsafeParseSvgString("<svg>....</svg>")),
  // And similarly for HTML elements:
  foreignHtmlElement(DomApi.unsafeParseHtmlString("<div onclick="alert('pwned')"></div>"))
)
```

These unsafe methods expose you to [XSS attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) so you should not run them on untrusted strings.

All these new methods have a few variations for different use cases, you'll find them when needed.



### CSS API Improvements

#### Unit and function helpers

Previously if you wanted to set a pixel value to a CSS style prop, you would need to append "px" or some other unit to your desired number. That's annoying, and with observables it might require the overhead of creating another observable with `.map(s"${_}px")`.

You can still do it the old way, but the new API offers several ways to set style values in units like `px`, `vh`, `percent`, `ms`, etc.:

```scala
div(
  margin.px := 12,
  marginTop.px := 12,
  marginTop.px(12), // remember that all `:=` methods in Laminar are aliased to `apply` for convenience!
  marginTop.calc("12px + 50%"),
  marginTop.px <-- streamOfInts,
  marginTop.px <-- streamOfDoubles
)
```

The new API is type-safe, so for example `backgroundImage.px` does not exist, but `.url` does:

```scala
div
  // Equivalent to CSS:  background-image: url("https://example.com/image.png")
  backgroundImage.url := "https://example.com/image.png"),
  backgroundImage.url("https://example.com/image.png"), // same
  backgroundImage.url <-- streamOfUrls
)
```

I haven't decided how to treat some of the more complex composite CSS properties yet, so some of them still only accept strings, which means that you can do `borderWidth.px := 12` but can't do `border.px := 12` yet. But you can use the new `style` string helpers: `style.px(12)` returns a plain "12px" string which you can use like `border := style.px(12)`.

#### Get string values from style keyword setters

You could already use keyword shorthands like `display.none` – that modifier is equivalent to `display := "none"`, and now you can also use get string constants from these modifiers with their newly exposed `value` property, which is sometimes nice to have in observables composition:

```scala
div(
  textAlign <-- streamOfBooleans.map(
    if (_) "left" else "right"
  ),
  // Same, but you get to marvel at your IDE knowing these symbols
  textAlign <-- streamOfBooleans.map(
    if (_) textAlign.left.value else textAlign.right.value
  )
)
```

Want a bit less boilerplate? Define a trivial implicit conversion from `StyleSetter[String]` to `String`, and you won't need to call `.value` manually. This is a bit too magicky for Laminar core though.

#### Vendor prefixes

Not super relevant feature these days, but you can now do this to set a style property along with several prefixes:

```scala
div(
  transition.withPrefixes(_.moz, _.ms, _.webkit) := "all 4s ease" // similarly for <--
)
```



## New Airstream Semantics

## New Airstream Features


### `take` and `drop` operators

The new `stream.take(numEvents)` operator returns a stream that re-emits the first `numEvents` events emitted by the parent `stream`, and then stops emitting. `stream.drop(numEvents)` does the opposite, skipping the first `numEvents` events and then starting to re-emit everything that the parent `stream` emits.

These operators are available with several signatures:

```scala
stream.take(numEvents = 5)
stream.takeWhile(ev => passes(ev)) // stop taking when `passes(ev)` returns `false`
stream.takeUntil(ev => passes(ev)) // stop taking when `passes(ev)` returns `true`
```

```scala
stream.drop(numEvents = 5)
stream.dropWhile(ev => passes(ev)) // stop skipping when `passes(ev)` returns `false`
stream.dropUntil(ev => passes(ev)) // stop skipping when `passes(ev)` returns `true`
```

Like many other operators, these have an optional `resetOnStop` argument. Defaults to `false`, but if set to `true`, they "forget" everything and are reset to their original state after the parent stream is stopped and then started again.


### `filterWith` operator

`stream.filterWith(signalOfBooleans)` emits only when the given signal's (or Var's) current value is `true`.

Can be used with Laminar's new `compose` method to filter DOM events too: 

```scala
div(onClick.compose(_.filterWith(clickEnabledVar)) --> observer)
```


### `collectSome`, `collectOpt` operators

`(stream: EventStream[Option[A]]).collectSome` returns an `EventStream[A]`.

`collectOpt` is similar: `def collectOpt[B](fn: A => Option[B]): EventStream[B]`, useful for methods like `NonEmptyList.from(list): Option[NonEmptyList]`.


### EventStream.after(ms) shorthand

`EventStream.after(ms, optionalValue)` emits `optionalValue` (or `()` if omitted) `ms` milliseconds after the stream is started. Useful to delay some action after the component is mounted, e.g.:

```scala
div(
  EventStream.after(5000) --> showBullshitMarketingPopup
)
```


### Signal.fromFuture with initial value

`Signal.fromFuture(future)` produces a `Signal[Option[A]]` which you can work around, but is annoying. Now you can specify `initialValue: A` as the second argument, and get a `Signal[A]` that will start with that value if the `future` is not yet resolved. 


### Flatten streams of signals

We now have a FlattenStrategy that supports this particular combination of observables before. You can do that now: `stream.flatMap(v => makeFooSignal(v))` returns `EventStream[Foo]`, and works similar to switching streams. 


### `throwFailure` operator

Turns `Observable[Try[A]]` into `Observable[A]`, moving the failure into the error channel. From when you want to un-recover from `recoverToTry`.



## Changes to `scala.Future` integration 

Airstream lets you create streams and signals from scala Futures and JS promises. Future based functionality is now implemented using `js.Promise`, instead of the opposite, to avoid surprising behaviour in some edge cases.

This means that if you don't use Futures but use JS Promises, your code is now scala.Future-free, and your JS bundle should get slimmer as a result (unless your other dependencies still use Futures). This also means that Future-based streams have a few milliseconds of extra latency now as the futures need to be translated to js.Promise. Since they're asynchronous by nature, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you're very unlucky, this might expose previously unknown expose race conditions in your code.

**#Migration** This results in the following breaking changes:

API: `Signal.fromFuture` always emits asynchronously now, that is, it always starts with a None value (or the provided initial value), even if the future/promise has already resolved when it's observed (because there's absolutely no way to synchronously observe the content of a `js.Promise`).

`EventStream.fromFuture` does not offer the emitIfFutureCompleted option anymore, it is now always on. It also has a new option: emitOnce.

API: Internet Explorer 11 support now requires a `js.Promise` polyfill to use `fromFuture` methods, because Internet Explorer does not natively support JS Promises. See [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36016327/how-to-support-promises-in-internet-explorer-11).

API: Removed `SwitchFutureStrategy`, you can't directly flatten observables of futures anymore, because that behaviour isn't defined well enough.

  * **Migration:** When flattening observables of futures, wrap them in `EventStream.fromFuture` or `Signal.fromFuture` to make sure that you're getting what you expect. Then SwitchStreamStrategy or SwitchSignalStrategy will apply.

API: Disabled implicit conversions from Future and js.Promise to `Source`. They're not smooth / obvious enough to be implicit.

* **Migration**: same, doing it explicitly.

API: `fromFuture` methods require an implicit `ExecutionContext` now.

* **Migration:** Read [this explanation](https://www.scala-js.org/news/2021/12/10/announcing-scalajs-1.8.0/) by the Scala.js team, and choose which execution context you want to use.



## Minor Breaking Changes

**Migration** should be obvious for these. Most of these likely won't even affect you.

* `split` operator now provides signals only, no streams. This goes both for the return value of the operator and the argument type of the callback that it accepts.

* Remove `splitIntoSignals` method – use `split` (see above)

* Laminar node types like `ChildNode` don’t extend the corresponding `com.raquo.domtypes` types anymore (they were removed from domtypes)

* Some rarely used CSS style shorthands like `unicodeBidi.embed` were removed. Use regular strings to set the desired values, e.g. `unicodeBidi := “embed”`

* `DomApi.createHtmlElement` accepts `HtmlTag` now instead of `HtmlElement`. Similarly for `createSvgElement`.

* `Debugger` doesn't have `topoRank` field anymore (it was useless)

* Remove `Id[A] = A` type from `util` – define your own if you need it

* Remove hidden `Ref` util class – use the new `distinct*` methods

* Removed deprecated methods

* EventStream.periodic

  * `resetOnStop` default changed from `true` to `false` in accordance with new semantics

  * Removed `emitInitial `option. It's always `true` now. Use the new `drop(1, resetOnStop = true)` operator to approximate previous `emitInitial = false` behaviour.



## Changes Relevant To Extensions

**Migration:** These changes are really only relevant to library authors and advanced users who extend Airstream and Laminar classes – the vast majority of regular end users is not affected by these changes.

These are all in addition to everything else in this changelog, and the various technical changes driven by New Airstream Semantics (see above).

* All `<X>EventStream` types were renamed to `<X>Stream`, except for `EventStream` itself and `DomEventStream`. The renamed types are not really user-facing except for `AjaxEventStream`, for which a deprecated alias is provided for now. You know what it feels like to have `<X>Stream.scala` and `<X>Signal.scala` files always next to each other when sorted alphabetically? Bliss.

* `Modifier` type moved from _Scala DOM Types_ to Laminar

* `Modifier`'s generic type param is constrained now, so you can’t use `Modifier[_]` won't compile anymore, use `Modifier.Base`.

* No more `SingleParentObservable`. Replace with `SingleParentSignal` and `SingleParentStream`

* `Splittable` now requires `empty`. `IdSplittable` is removed.

* Rename `Protected.maxParentTopoRank` to `Protected.maxTopoRank`

* Laminar `Key` types like `ReactiveProp`, `ReactiveHtmlAttr`, etc. were renamed to remove the “Reactive” prefix, and don’t extend the corresponding `com.raquo.domtypes` types anymore (those types were removed from _Scala DOM Types_)

* Laminar `Node` types like `ChildNode` don’t extend the corresponding `com.raquo.domtypes` types anymore (those types were removed from _Scala DOM Types_)

* `ReactiveHtmlElement` and `ReactiveSvgElement` now accept `ref` as a parameter. Use this wisely. Note that new helper methods are now available to inject foreign elements into Laminar tree (see above), so you shouldn’t need to use these constructors directly.

* `BaseObservable#equals` method now always compares observables by reference, and that's made `final`. In practice this means that creating case class subtypes of observables won’t accidentally break Airstream.



## Other Minor Changes

Fix: Debug logging does not wrap text in extraneous "Some()" and "None" anymore

Fix: Prevent text cursor from jumping to the end of the input in Safari when using the controlled-input pattern without using Laminar’s `controlled` method. ([#110](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar/issues/110))

API: You can now pass the two arguments to `controlled()`in reverse order too



## User-facing Renamings

**Migration:** find and rename these as they fail to compile

* Laminar `Key` types like `ReactiveProp`, `ReactiveHtmlAttr`, `ReactiveComplexHtmlKeys`, etc. were renamed to remove the “Reactive” prefix. `ReactiveStyle` was renamed to `StyleProp`.

* `content` style prop renamed to `contentCss` to avoid being shadowed by a common variable name.

* `EventStream.withCallback`, `withJsCallback`, `withObserver` → `withCallback`, `withJsCallback`, `withObserver`

* Observable operators:
  * `contramapOpt` → `contracollectOpt`
  * `foldLeft` and `foldLeftRecover` → `scanLeft` and `scanLeftRecover`

* Manual dynamic subscription factories require that you don't manually kill the `Subscription` that you create, that you let the resulting DynamicSubscription manage it. They were renamed and commented to reflect that:
  * `DynamicSubscription.apply` → `DynamicSubscription.unsafe`
  * `ReactiveElement.bindSubscription` → `ReactiveElement.bindSubscriptionUnsafe`

* `DomEventStreamPropBuilder` → `StreamEventPropBuilder`

* `customStyle` → `customStyleProp` (deprecated alias available)

* `KeyUpdater.$value` → `KeyUpdater.values`

* Debug API
  * `debugSpyInitialEval` → `debugSpyEvalFromParent`
  * `debugBreakInitialEval` → `debugBreakEvalFromParent`
  * `debugLogInitialEval` → `debugLogEvalFromParent`
  * `Debugger.onInitialEval` → `Debugger.onCurrentValueFromParent`
